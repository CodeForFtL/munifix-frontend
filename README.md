# MuniFix
### A project to help report problems with Broward County roads and infrastructure


Check it out! (http://codeforftl.org/munifix-frontend/) This website will show what is on the gh-pages branch. I just created a second website (http://codeforftl.org/munifix-frontend/fading/), which has a fading effect I'd like to hear your opinions on.


Please remember to add a link to the backend of this project, when it has a repo!!
