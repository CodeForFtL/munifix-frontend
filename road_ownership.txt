I was given a pdf showing road ownership in Broward County. It might come in handy for determining who to report road issues to.
Here is a link to the pdf for whoever is going to be populating the database or to add to the repository:

This file should probably be deleted from the repository after pdf is downloaded.
P.S. Is issue tracking enabled on this repository?
